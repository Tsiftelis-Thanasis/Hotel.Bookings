I have done the following:
An Api with 2 controllers, for the hotels and the bookings.
Each controller contains Get, GetAll, Create and Edit method.
Each controller is using a repository for the Bookings and a repository for the Hotels.

I added a caching mechanism and a DB store mechanism.
If it's not in the cache it might be in the store, if it's not then I query the DB.


I added a small logger.
I added a background service for future use. For example if we need to update our hotels or bookings from another source or api.

I am not familiar with unit test.
I tried to do some proper testing but I didn't achieve it.


Some info for the database:
Name: Bookings
Table Scripts:

USE [Bookings]
GO

/****** Object: Table [dbo].[Bookings] Script Date: 22/3/2023 3:20:45 μμ ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Bookings] (
    [Id]           INT           IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [HotelId]      INT           NOT NULL,
    [CustomerName] VARCHAR (50)  NOT NULL,
    [NumOfPax]     INT           NOT NULL,
    [CreatedAt]    DATETIME2 (7) NOT NULL,
    [UpdatedAt]    DATETIME2 (7) NULL
);

USE [Bookings]
GO

/****** Object: Table [dbo].[Hotels] Script Date: 22/3/2023 3:21:03 μμ ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Hotels] (
    [Id]         INT           IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
